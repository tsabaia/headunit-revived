Headunit Revived is an Android app that allows you to turn your Android tablet or phone into an Android Auto receiver. This project is a revived version of the original headunit project by the great Michael Reid. The original project can be found here:

## How to use
**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/andreknieriem/headunit-revived/wiki) for detailed documentation, setup guides and troubleshooting!**

### Wired USB Connection
- Connect your Android device (phone) to the tablet running Headunit Revived via USB cable.
- Make sure that Android Auto is installed on your phone.
- Set your phone to Host-Mode if nescessary and select Android Auto
- Click the USB Button in Headunit Revived, find your phone and click the right button to allow connection
- Click on your phone in the list and wait for Android Auto to start

### Wireless Launcher (Recommended)
This is the most reliable way to connect wirelessly. It uses a launcher utility on your phone to trigger the connection.

- **Option A (New):** Use the [Wireless Helper](https://github.com/andreknieriem/wireless-helper) app. 
  - Join the **Beta Test** here: [Google Play Store Beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.andrerinas.wirelesshelper)
  - Minimal configuration, supports NSD and Bluetooth Auto-Start.
- **Option B:** Use the original [Wireless Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.borconi.emil.wifilauncherforhur) on your phone.

**Setup:**
- In Headunit Revived Settings: Set **Wireless Mode** to **Helper Mode**.
- Ensure both devices are in the same network (Hotspot or WiFi).
- Open the Launcher App on your phone and start the service.
- The Launcher will find your headunit and initiate the connection automatically.

### Wireless Connection (Manual / Native)
This method uses the native "Headunit Server" built into Android Auto developer settings.
**Note:** This method may fail on some devices/networks (especially mobile hotspots creating 10.x.x.x networks) due to firewall/routing restrictions on the phone side. If this fails, please use the Wireless Launcher method.

- Open Android Auto Settings on your phone
- Click on Version and then on version and permission and click several to enable developer settings
- Go back to Android Auto, click the three dots on the top right and start the infotainment server
- Now you need to bring your phone and headunit(tablet) into the same network (WiFi).
- Go to the WiFi Menu in the Headunit Revive App
- Click scan. If your phone is found, click on the IP to connect.
- Or: manually add your phones ip address via "Add new" button.

### Connect Wirelessly via Intent (Power Users)
You can trigger a wireless connection attempt using an Android Intent. This is useful for automation tools like **Tasker**, **MacroDroid**, or via **ADB**.

**URI Scheme:** `headunit://connect?ip=<PHONE_IP>`

**Example ADB Command:**
```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "headunit://connect?ip=192.168.1.25"
```

## Known Issues
- **Google Maps in Portrait Mode:** Touch interactions (searching, scrolling) within Google Maps may not work as expected when using Portrait Mode. While visual feedback (like ripple effects) might appear, the map itself may remain unresponsive. This appears to be an internal Android Auto / Google Maps limitation or bug in vertical orientations.

## Contributing

Creating release apk needs a keystore file. You can create your own keystore file using the following command in root folder:
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore headunit-release-key.jks -alias headunit-revived -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`  

After that you need to set the env variables depending on your OS:
MAC:
open ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

`sudo nano ~/.zshrc or sudo nano ~/.bashrc`   
`export HEADUNIT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"  
export HEADUNIT_KEY_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"`  

## Original Headunit
Headunit for Android Auto (tm)

A new car or a $600+ headunit is NOT required to enjoy the integration and distraction reduced environment of Android Auto.

This headunit app can turn a Android 4.1+ tablet supporting USB Host mode into a basic Android Auto compatible headunit.
