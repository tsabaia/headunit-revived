/**
 * The full state table is spelled out because the watchdog's original inline check accepted only
 * HandshakeComplete — a state the session passes through once, briefly — and returned without
 * re-posting, so it died on the first tick of every session. TransportStarted being live is the
 * regression this table pins.
 *
 * The overlay and recovery tables pin the other half of that history. Reviving the watchdog made its
 * frame-only criterion reachable for the first time, and it promptly called an idle Android Auto
 * screen a lost connection (issue #852). The two decisions were split rather than retuned, so the
 * cases that matter are the asymmetric ones: a stopped picture on a live link must produce recovery
 * and no overlay, and neither signal alone is enough for the overlay.
