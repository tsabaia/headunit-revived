 * app prints can be checked against what the offline script printed for the same link.
 *
 * The tests that matter most are the ones asserting silence. An instrument that speaks on a healthy
 * session gets ignored on an unhealthy one, and that is not hypothetical here: it is what happened
 * to the framing audit, which spent its whole print budget on false positives in the first 200 ms
