/**
 * Two things are pinned here, and both came from measurements rather than reasoning.
 *
 * Every head unit below Android 10 reports the group frequency as zero, which is most of the
 * hardware that files a bug about projected video, and the original line told all of them to
 * disconnect the network they were joined to on the strength of a comparison it could not make. On
 * the unit that prompted the change that advice pointed at the only configuration that worked.
 *
 * Then a rig on Android 14, where both frequencies *are* readable and 260 MHz apart, ran ten clean
 * minutes at 45-55 fps in exactly the state the surviving warning describes. So no branch prescribes
 * anything any more - `assertNoPrescription` is applied to all five.
