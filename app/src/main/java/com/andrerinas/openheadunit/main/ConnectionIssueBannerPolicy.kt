     *
     * - `BLUETOOTH_SENT_NO_DATA` and `BSSID_UNAVAILABLE` are raised in `NativeAaHandshakeManager`,

     *   only WiFi Direct aborts — the hotspot transport sends an empty BSSID and carries on
     *   (`NativeCredentialsPolicy.onUnusableBssid`).
     * - `HOTSPOT_NOT_RUNNING` and `HOTSPOT_CONFIG_UNREADABLE` are raised in `SoftApCredentialsProvider`, which only the
     *   Native AA hotspot transport ever constructs. Helper strategy 4 rides its own access point
     *   too but never resolves credentials from it, so it cannot raise this and does not appear
     *   here — which is also why this takes no `helperConnectionStrategy`: no rule uses it.

     * A record is not deleted when it stops applying. It describes what the hardware did, and the
     * user may well be back on that route tomorrow; it is only hidden while it cannot be the

     * These records are cleared only by something that *disproves* them, which the user typing a
     * value never does: the device that would not name its own access point still will not, and the
     * unit that could not read its own address still cannot. So a user who typed the hotspot name
     * the banner asked for, and whose access point then happens to be off at the next launch, would
     * be told again to enter it by hand. The record stays; the instruction stops.
     *
     * That makes this function load-bearing rather than cosmetic. It is now the only thing keeping
     * a worked-around condition off the screen, and the publish sites that decline to retire those
     * records rely on it - `SoftApCredentialsPolicy.disprovesConfigUnreadable` and
     * `SoftApBssidPolicy.disprovesBssidUnavailable` are its exact complements, and a test asserts
     * that every state one of them declines to retire is one this function hides.
     *
     * `BLUETOOTH_SENT_NO_DATA` has no entry because its remedy is leaving Native AA, which
     * [relevantNow] already answers. `HOTSPOT_NOT_RUNNING` has none either: no setting fixes it,
     * and switching the access point on disproves it outright, so the record retires itself.

     *   as well as the name, and not as an alternative to it: once a manual name is set the
     *   device's own configuration is never read, so the passphrase has nothing to fall back to
     *   and an unset one is sent as an open network the phone refuses. See
     *   [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.aap.SoftApCredentialsPolicy.resolve].
     * @param staticBssid [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.utils.Settings.staticBSSID], judged by the
