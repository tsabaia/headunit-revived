/**
 * Gathers microphone reads into the fixed-size messages the protocol asks for.
 *
 * Google's head unit guide gives the microphone a 2048-frame buffer and requires frames to be a
 * multiple of it; AudioRecord hands back whatever the device feels like, and reporter logs show 640
 * and 768 frames. The old sender also dropped any read of 64 bytes or fewer outright, so a short
 * read became a hole rather than a wait.
 *
 * Stateful, and two details are the reason this is an object rather than four lines in the
 * transport. A chunk is stamped with the capture time of its **first** byte, not of the read that
 * completed it, because a chunk is 128 ms long and stamping at the end would put every message that
 * far out. And the tail left over when capture stops is **discarded, never padded**: zero padding
 * injects silence the microphone never heard into a speech stream, and a short final message
 * violates the multiple-of-2048 rule.
 *
 * Pure: no Android, no logging, no clock of its own.
