/**
 * How long the transport's read thread may wait for space in the feed queue before a frame is shed.
 *
 * A full queue used to shed the arriving access unit immediately. On a decoder running at its
 * ceiling - decoding and rendering continuously, just slower than the phone sends - that turned
 * every arrival burst into shed units, and every unit in this stream is a reference frame, so each
 * one cost a washed-out, blocky picture until the phone's own keyframe, tens of seconds away.
 * Measured on an MT6735 at 1080p60: two bursts of ~50 shed frames each, artifacts for the rest of
 * the session.
 *
 * Waiting here instead is the protocol's own flow control. Media acks are sent after a message is
 * processed, and the phone stops sending once its unacked-message window fills - so a read thread
 * paced by this wait closes that window within a handful of messages and the phone throttles
 * itself to the rate the codec actually drains. That is how the pipeline behaved before the feed
 * queue existed, and the same hardware ran artifact-free then. The queue keeps its own job: a
 * burst after a link stall still lands in it whole and is caught up at render time, and in steady
 * state at the codec's ceiling the wait per frame is one frame period, not the budget.
 *
 * The wait is bounded because a codec can also be wedged rather than slow. Past [WAIT_BUDGET_MS]
 * the frame is shed exactly as before, and the wedge belongs to the sync_stall watchdog.
 *
 * **The paced thread carries audio too.** One read thread serves the session, and this budget is the
 * same order as the audio sink's own depth, so a codec at its ceiling can push audio into the drop
 * path in [AudioTrackWrapper.write] rather than merely delaying it. Unmeasured, because the units
 * that stutter are link-starved and never take the wait. Raising this budget spends audio headroom
 * as well as video latency.
