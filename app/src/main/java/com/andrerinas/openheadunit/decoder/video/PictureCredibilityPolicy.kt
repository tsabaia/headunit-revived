 * Whether frames reaching the screen amount to a picture, or only to output.

 * A codec rebuilt against a new surface keeps its cached parameter sets, so it configures and starts
 * on a P-frame and some components emit output from it - gray, but rendered. Every recovery gate that
 * asks "has a frame rendered on this surface" then reads that as a working picture and stands down,
 * and the screen stays gray until the phone's next natural keyframe, up to a full GOP away.
 *
 * The question those gates need answered is whether a keyframe accounts for what is on screen.
 * [KeyframeRepairTracker] already tracks that per codec instance; this turns it into the one boolean
 * the gates read.
