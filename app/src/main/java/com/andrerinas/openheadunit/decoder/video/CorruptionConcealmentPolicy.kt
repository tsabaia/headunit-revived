/**
 * Decides, per output buffer, whether the screen shows it - so a stream that just lost an access
 * unit freezes on the last good frame instead of melting through every P-frame that references a
 * picture the decoder never had.
 *
 * ### Why the gate is on the render and nowhere else
 *
 * Two earlier concealment mechanisms were removed for latching, and their post-mortems set the
 * constraints this satisfies. Gating the *feed* starved the codec outright; reading NAL types
 * against the user's codec preference misread every keyframe in reachable configurations; and an
 * unbounded hold froze a healthy session. So this object gates only [Outcome.renders]: the feed
 * is untouched, the codec keeps decoding and keeps its reference state current, and the worst
 * possible failure is the screen showing the wrong subset of frames for a bounded time. It never
 * reads a NAL itself - the repair signal comes in from [KeyframeRepairTracker], whose scan runs
 * against the decoder's *pinned* codec type and which carries its own escape hatch for components
 * with unusable output timestamps.
 *
 * ### Why the freeze is worth having at all
 *
 * The protocol has no keyframe request, so an unbounded freeze would run to the phone's own
 * roughly-a-minute GOP, which is why an earlier freeze proposal was rejected. What changed is the
 * escalation: a corrupt access unit now earns a focus release/regain cycle that produces a
 * keyframe in under three seconds. A freeze bounded just above that hides the melt for the whole
 * of a successful repair and costs at most [CONCEAL_MAX_MS] of still picture when the repair does
 * not come.
 *
 * ### The no-latch guarantees, each pinned by a test
 *
 * The window is measured from the *first* corruption report ([CONCEAL_MAX_MS] from
 * `windowOpenedMs`); later reports never extend it. A window that expires [Outcome.CLOSE_EXPIRED]
 * disarms this policy until a keyframe repairs the picture, so sustained loss buys exactly one
 * freeze and then the honest smear - never a strobing alternation of the two. A lost window stamp
 * (`windowOpenedMs == 0` while [State.CONCEALING]) reads as an expired window, so the failure
 * mode of broken bookkeeping is *resuming*, not freezing. And the caller is expected to consult
 * this once per output-loop tick as well as per buffer, so the cap holds even when the phone goes
 * idle mid-window and no further buffers arrive.
 *
 * The caller owns the state and must consume the corruption report it passes in *whatever* the
 * outcome is - a report arriving while [State.DISARMED] is answered with [Outcome.SHOW] and must
 * not be kept around to reopen a window after the next repair.
