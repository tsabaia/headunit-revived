/**
 * What to show in the Bluetooth address field before the user has typed anything.
 *
 * The address is how the phone is told where to connect hands-free, and Android Auto disables
 * telephony until that link is up - so a blank field is why "calls stay on the phone" on a head
 * unit that has a perfectly good Bluetooth car kit. BluetoothHelper has resolved the real address
 * for years and only ever used it to build description strings.
 *
 * Never overwrites what the user typed: a hand-entered address is usually there because the
 * detected one was wrong.
 *
 * Pure: no Android.
