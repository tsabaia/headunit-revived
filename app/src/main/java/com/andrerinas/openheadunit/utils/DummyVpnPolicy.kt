 * Who owns the dummy VPN, and which teardowns are allowed to take it down.
 *
 * The VPN used to be stopped from the last line of [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.aap.AapService.stopWirelessServer], which
 * [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.aap.AapService.initWifiMode] calls on every mode change. A user reported the VPN icon vanishing on
 * their second connection, and their log shows exactly that: `initWifiMode` at 03:28:00.278,
 * `VpnControl.stopVpn` three milliseconds later. The wireless server never owned it.
 *
 * Ownership is what replaces that. A teardown may only stop a VPN whose owner it is responsible
 * for, and a VPN this app did not start is never touched at all.
