 * time the user is in front of the app with a keyboard nothing anywhere says what went wrong. This
 * is the copy that survives, and the main screen is where it is read.
 *
 * The one surface, deliberately. A toast and a notification carried the same three verdicts for a
 * while, and both were added before this existed - the toast gone in seconds, the notification gone
 * the moment somebody swipes it. Three places to say one thing is three places to keep in step, and
 * the durable one is the only one that answers the question the user actually arrives with.
 *
 * Every condition is raised at the site that detects it and cleared at the site that disproves it.
 * Nothing here is cleared by a manager restarting, a mode change or a user exit: those change what
 * the app is doing, not what the hardware did.
 *
 * **A workaround is not a disproof**, and that distinction was paid for. A hand-typed hotspot name
 * or static BSSID makes a route work without making the hardware answer, so a record survives its
 * own remedy and is merely hidden, by
 * [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.main.ConnectionIssueBannerPolicy.remedyApplied]. Retiring one on a
 * workaround used to delete the only durable instruction a half-finished remedy had left.
