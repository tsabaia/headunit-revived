/**
 * Supplies the Native AA handshake with the credentials of *this head unit's own access point*,
 * as an alternative to [WifiDirectManager]'s P2P group.
 *
 * A teardown of the OEM ZLink app showed it doing wireless Android Auto over an ordinary WPA2 soft
 * AP — same Bluetooth handshake, same UUID, no WiFi Direct — so the phone accepts a plain access
 * point, and that route sidesteps the P2P failure modes behind most Native AA reports: group
 * churn, the self-wake loop, phones stuck on "Obtaining IP address".
 *
 * It does not copy ZLink's way of *starting* the AP; that needs TETHER_PRIVILEGED and root
 * daemons. Reading a hotspot the user configured is the load-bearing path, switching one on is
 * best effort. Same contract as [WifiDirectManager] so a launcher can treat both transports alike.
