/**
 * How hard to keep retrying a peer that accepts the TCP connection and then says nothing.
 *
 * Android Auto's built-in head unit server (the "Start head unit server" developer option,
 * port 5277) is a proxy, not an AAP server: it accepts, hands the socket to its own car service
 * over binder, and waits there with no timeout. Its accept loop is serial, so while one connection
 * is parked every later one sits in the kernel backlog, completed by the kernel alone and never
 * served or closed. Stopping the server closes only its listening socket and does not interrupt
 * the parked one, so only killing Android Auto clears it.
 *
 * So retrying at the normal cadence cannot succeed, and it is not free: each attempt strands
 * another socket on the phone, which never reaps them either.
 *
 * Back off instead, and say once what is actually wrong. Backing off rather than stopping
 * matters: the user can fix this from the phone at any moment, and an app that has given up
 * for good would not notice.
