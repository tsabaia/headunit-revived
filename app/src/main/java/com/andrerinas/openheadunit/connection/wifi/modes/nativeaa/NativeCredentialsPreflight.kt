 * The reads are chosen for one property: a negative answer here has to mean the same thing it would
 * mean during a handshake. That holds for the hotspot name and passphrase, because

 * configuration - a device that refuses it now refuses it with the access point up too. It does not
 * hold for a MAC, which has to be read off an interface that exists, so that answer is reported as
 * inconclusive rather than negative whenever there was nothing to read from.
