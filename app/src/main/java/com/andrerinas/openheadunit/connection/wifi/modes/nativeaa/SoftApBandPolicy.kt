/**
 * Which band to bring the head unit's access point up on for wireless Android Auto, and in what
 * order to try.
 *
 * What the band costs, measured 2026-08-05 on a head unit hotspot. Over a 2.4 GHz access point at
 * 1080p/60 the phone completed the handshake, joined the network and opened the video channel, then
 * closed the socket having sent no frame at all: thirty-two times in under five minutes. On the
 * *same* access point on the *same* band, an 800x480/30 stream held for as long as it was watched,
 * and at 1080p/60 on 5 GHz it held too.
 *
 * So this is a throughput ceiling rather than a dead band, and 5 GHz is the default because it is
 * the only band measured to carry a full-resolution stream, not because 2.4 GHz carries nothing.
 * [VideoStarvationPolicy] is where that measurement is recorded in full and where the advice
 * reaches the user; this object only decides what to ask the radio for.
 *
 * The two band hints on the settings screen round that ceiling to "reliable up to 720p", which sits
 * between the two figures above and was never itself measured. That is deliberate: the numbers here
 * are 480p holding and 1080p dying, and a hint that quoted both would be asking a user to work out
 * where their own panel falls between them. Do not "correct" the strings back to the raw pair.
 *
 * The reference head unit software running this route on the same class of hardware brings its AP
 * up on channel 36, and the AA protocol itself carries the phone's answer to the same question
 * (`selected_wifi_channel_type`, one of 2.4-only / 5-only / dual), which this app does not read.
 *
 * @see VideoStarvationPolicy

     *
     * [HotspotBandPreference.FORCE_5GHZ] exists because the fallback is not free: a session on
     * 2.4 GHz can connect, look entirely healthy and show nothing, which is harder to diagnose than
     * no access point at all. It also halves the worst case, one bring-up window instead of two.
     * [HotspotBandPreference.FORCE_2_4GHZ] is for a radio that will not host 5 GHz, and wants a
     * lower resolution and frame rate to go with it.
