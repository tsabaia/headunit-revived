/**
 * What to say when this unit is joined to an ordinary WiFi network while hosting the group.
 *
 * One radio serving a station link and a group owner at once has to divide its time between them,
 * and when the two sit on different channels it also has to retune between them, which on a
 * single-channel chipset can stall projected video and audio together. That is worth telling a
 * reporter about. It is only worth telling them about when it has actually been established.
 *
 * The line this replaces did not establish it. `WifiP2pGroup.getFrequency()` arrived in API 29, so
 * every head unit below that reports the group frequency as zero - which is the whole class of
 * hardware that files this kind of bug - and the warning went out anyway, telling the user to
 * disconnect the other network on the strength of a comparison it had just described as
 * unavailable. On the unit that prompted this it fired on all three good runs and on neither bad
 * one: joined to a network the session had no dropout longer than 0.65 s in 138 s and no audio
 * underrun at all, and unjoined it lost the picture for four to eight seconds every ten and
 * underran thirty times. Advice that inverts the outcome is worse than silence.
 *
 * A rig then fired the surviving warning on a session that was measurably clean: two known
 * frequencies 260 MHz apart, and ten minutes at 45-55 fps with no gap on any channel. That is two
 * units now - the reporter's, where joined was the *good* configuration, and this one, where it cost
 * nothing - and no measurement anywhere in which disconnecting the station helped. The retune is
 * real physics and worth naming in a log a reporter attaches to an issue; telling them to act on it
 * is not supported by anything. So this object now describes and never prescribes.
 *
 * Pure, so every combination is a unit test rather than a device.
