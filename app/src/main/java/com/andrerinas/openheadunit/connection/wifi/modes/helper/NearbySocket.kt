 * exists once the phone sends its own payload back, so a read issued before that has to wait. The
 * wait is bounded: a phone that never completes the tunnel used to park the handshake thread
 * indefinitely, and the fault surfaced minutes later as an unexplained Nearby payload failure with
 * nothing in the log connecting the two. A bounded wait names the peer as the cause at the moment
