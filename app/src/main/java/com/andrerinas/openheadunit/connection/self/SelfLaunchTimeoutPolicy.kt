 * How long a Self Mode launch may take before the user is told it did not work, and what may be
 * torn down when that happens.
 *
 * The deadline used to be 2500 ms for both routes, and expiring it called `CommManager.emitError`,
 * which disconnects. On [SelfLaunchPath.LEGACY] that is self-defeating twice over: the disconnect
 * takes down the dummy VPN whose `Network` we just handed Gearhead as `PARAM_SERVICE_WIFI_NETWORK`,
 * and it closes the port 5288 server that is the only way the phone can arrive. Gearhead needs 15
 * to 20 s on that route, so the deadline expired every time and killed sessions that were working.
 *
 * Hence the two rules here. A deadline the slower route can actually meet, and a timeout that
 * reports without tearing anything down - the launch may still be in flight, and on the head unit
 * server route a connection dropped before the AAP version exchange leaves that server deaf until
 * the user restarts it by hand.
