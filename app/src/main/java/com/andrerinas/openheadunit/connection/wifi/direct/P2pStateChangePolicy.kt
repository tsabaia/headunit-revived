 * Some drivers reload the P2P interface to create a group or apply an operating channel, which
 * raises DISABLED then ENABLED within milliseconds. Read literally that says "the user turned WiFi
 * Direct off and on", so the receiver cleared its in-flight latches and started another bring-up,
 * which reloaded the interface again: a 45 Hz loop that never let one group finish. Both rules below
 * come off a single timestamp so there is no latch to leak if a bring-up never reports an outcome.
