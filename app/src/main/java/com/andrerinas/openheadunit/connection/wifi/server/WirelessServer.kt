/**
 * Coroutine-based server that listens for incoming TCP connections on port 5288.
 *
 * Registers the service over mDNS (NSD) as `_aawireless._tcp` so Android Auto
 * Wireless clients can discover it automatically. Each accepted socket is handed
 * off to [CommManager.connect] on the service coroutine scope. Only one connection
 * is allowed at a time; subsequent sockets are closed immediately.
 *
 * Uses [isActive] for cooperative cancellation. [stopServer] cancels the job and
 * closes the server socket to unblock the blocking [ServerSocket.accept] call.
