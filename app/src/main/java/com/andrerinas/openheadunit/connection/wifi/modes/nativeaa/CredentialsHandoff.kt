/**
 * Carries one set of credentials from the transport that resolved them to the listener that
 * forwards them, in whichever order the two arrive.
 *
 * A plain callback field cannot do this, and the difference is a whole dead connection rather than a
 * late one. The hotspot transport resolves on a background thread the instant it is started, and on
 * a unit whose access point is already up that takes tens of milliseconds. Measured at 44 ms on the
 * unit this was written for, while the service that owns the callback was still inside `onCreate`.
 * The delivery landed on a null field and was dropped. Nothing retried, because a transport that has
 * resolved its network stops looking: there is no second delivery to catch. The head unit then holds
 * a perfectly good access point and an open Bluetooth listener and never wakes the phone, which is
 * indistinguishable from idling.
 *
 * So the value waits for the listener rather than the other way round. Latest-value, not a queue:
 * credentials describe a network as it is now, and an older set describes one the phone can no
 * longer join.
 *
 * Callers run on different threads by construction (resolve on IO, registration on main), hence the
 * lock; delivery happens outside it, because the listener reaches all the way into the Bluetooth
 * handshake and holding a lock across that invites the deadlock this class exists to avoid.
