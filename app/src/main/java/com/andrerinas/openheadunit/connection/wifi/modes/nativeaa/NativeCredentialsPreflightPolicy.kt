 * [NativeCredentialsPolicy] names the missing BSSID. What is new is only the timing. Those verdicts
 * arrive while a phone is mid-handshake, as one line in a log and one toast on a screen nobody is
 * reading, and the overrides that fix them are described as "if the log says the name could not be
 * read" - so the failure is reported to the one audience least able to act on it. Most reports that
 * call this route dead are this, and the values needed were available in Settings the whole time.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest, and both matter more than coverage:
 *
 * - **Only certainties are reported.** [FieldVerdict.UNKNOWN] produces nothing. A check that cries
 *   wolf on a healthy unit gets ignored on a broken one.
 * - **Nothing is asked for that could not work.** The WiFi Direct route reports [CredentialField.BSSID]
 *   and nothing else: its network name and passphrase are generated by the framework for each group
 *   ([com.andrerinas.openheadunit.connection.WifiDirectManager] reads them back off `WifiP2pGroup`),
 *   so a name the user typed could not match the group the phone is told to join, and no setting for
 *   one exists.
 *
 * Pure, because the devices this is for are not devices available to test with. The outcome table in
 * `NativeCredentialsPreflightPolicyTest` is the only place the behaviour is checked.
