/**
 * What to shut down while a session is running over USB rather than over the air.
 *
 * Wireless bring-up is driven entirely by the stored `wifiConnectionMode`, and nothing in it ever
 * asked what the live session is riding on. `initWifiMode()` runs from `onCreate()` before USB is
 * even probed, and `onConnected()` stopped nothing, so a wired session carried the whole wireless
 * stack alongside it. A reporter's USB capture shows all of it at once: a P2P group created ten
 * seconds before the phone was plugged in and torn down only at user exit, RFCOMM listeners open,
 * Nearby discovering, the :5288 server bound, the Native AA join watchdog firing under a live
 * session at 03:01:35, and the Bluetooth poke loop still running 4.1 s after the SSL handshake.
 *
 * None of that can succeed while USB owns the session — no phone can join a group it is not
 * looking for — and some of it is actively harmful. A poke raises an OS-level ACL_CONNECTED, which
 * AutoStartReceiver treats exactly like the user's phone arriving, and the answer to that can be
 * `initWifiMode(force = true)`, which tears down and recreates the P2P group underneath a session
 * that is already up.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately blunt: if the session is not wireless, none of it should be running.
 * Symmetry is the part worth being careful about, so [shouldRearmWireless] exists rather than
 * leaving each caller to remember.
