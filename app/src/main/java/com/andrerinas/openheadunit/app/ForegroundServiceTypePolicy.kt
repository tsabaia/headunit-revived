/**
 * Which foreground-service types this service claims, and when.
 *
 * The microphone type cannot be claimed at service start. Since Android 14 it is a while-in-use
 * type, so holding the permission is necessary and not sufficient: a service started from the
 * background is refused with "the app must be in the eligible state/exemptions" even with
 * RECORD_AUDIO granted, and this service starts from boot, USB and Bluetooth receivers. Measured on
 * a background Bluetooth auto-start, five times out of five.
 *
 * So the start claims [baseTypeMask], which holds no while-in-use type and cannot be refused, and
 * the microphone is added by [withMicrophone] at the moment capture actually opens - by then the
 * projection is on screen and the app is eligible. It is dropped again when capture stops, so the
 * type is held only while it is true.
