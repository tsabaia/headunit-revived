/**
 * The one microphone format Android Auto is told about, and the only one it is ever sent.
 *
 * Google's head unit guide requires PCM 16 kHz 16-bit mono for speech, and Android Auto validates
 * the announced configuration: anything outside {16000, 48000} Hz, 16 bits and 1 or 2 channels is
 * rejected, and the teardown reasons include a bad microphone config. The announcement and the
 * capture used to be two separate literals, which is how a head unit came to declare 16 kHz and
 * send 48.
 *
 * That 48000 is not an option here. `AudioConfiguration` is one message shared by every audio
 * service, so the validator accepts the union across all of them, and 48 kHz is in it for the media
 * channel's stereo stream. For the microphone the guide names one rate.
