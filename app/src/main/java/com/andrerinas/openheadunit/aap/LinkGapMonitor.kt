/**
 * How long an inbound AAP series goes completely silent, and how often.
 *
 * Two reporters on Android 8.1 head units describe the same thing in the same words - the music
 * cuts in and out - and on both the fault is neither the audio path nor the decoder. The media
 * stops, on video and audio at once, on a fixed cadence, and then resumes. One capture measured
 * 1.59 s of silence every 11.57 s; another, on different hardware, 5-6 s every 10-11 s with the
 * picture and the sound dying together.
 *
 * Neither was readable from what the app prints. The only instrument that could see it was an
 * offline script over `RECV:` lines, which exist solely at VERBOSE - so recognising the first case
 * took a 151,366-line export, and the second could not be diagnosed at all, because the reporter
 * had been asked for INFO. A fault this distinctive should not need a special capture to notice.
 *
 * So the same measurement runs in the app, at INFO, reporting the fields the script reports so a
 * log line and a rig run can be compared directly.
 *
 * **One instance per series.** An instance fed every inbound message measures *the link*, and that
 * is the one thing this fault leaves alone: the phone sends a `CONTROL Ping Request` about once a
 * second for the life of the session, so a link carrying nothing but pings scores perfectly healthy
 * while both media channels are dead. Measured on five captures of the second waveform: the
 * all-channel series printed twice, 1.6-1.8 s in a 30 s window, across sessions whose picture was
 * gone for six seconds out of every ten. Separate instances for video and for audio are what make
 * that visible, and comparing the three is what says whether the link died or only the media did.
 *
 * **Diagnostic only - nothing reads the report.** The [GAP_THRESHOLD_MS] below rests on one
 * observed phone behaviour rather than on anything in the protocol, which is reason enough not to
 * hang recovery off it. The line says what was measured and leaves the conclusion to the reader.
 *
 * Pure and clock-free: the caller passes the time in, so every measured waveform is replayable in
 * a unit test.
 *
 * @param subject the noun this series names in its report line - the thing that went quiet.
 * @param minGapsToReport how many gaps a window needs before it is worth printing. See
 *   [MIN_GAPS_MEDIA] for why a media series wants more than one and the link series wants exactly
 *   one.
 * @param maxDeadPercentToReport how much of a window may be silence before it stops being a
 *   stuttering series and starts being a stopped one. See [MAX_DEAD_PERCENT_MEDIA].

         * hardware. The assumption it replaces was that an idle Android Auto screen sends *no*
         * video, one long silence per window, which [MIN_GAPS_MEDIA] would then suppress. What a
         * stationary map really sends is a trickle - an isolated packet every few seconds, a clock
         * tick or a location pulse - and every one of those arrivals closes a gap and opens a new
         * one. Measured on a rig, three untouched minutes on a stationary map: four windows, 2-5
         * gaps each, `dead=95%`, `99%`, `96%`, `99%`, and intervals scattered from 3.3 s to 17.9 s.
         * The floor above suppressed none of it.
         *
         * What separates that from the fault is not how many gaps there are but how much picture
         * runs between them. The reporter's waveform is 4-8 s of silence every 10.5 s with video
         * flowing at 45-55 fps in between - `dead` around 55-60%, and 22% on the milder capture. An
         * idle screen is 95-99%. Nothing measured has ever landed between, and this sits in the
         * middle of that gap.
         *
         * So a window this dead is not a stuttering picture, it is a stopped one, and a stopped
         * picture is somebody else's instrument: `ProjectionWatchdogPolicy` decides when to call it
         * a lost connection, and the decoder's own throughput line reports the rate. The cost of
         * this ceiling is that a fault severe enough to exceed it goes unnamed here - accepted,
         * because at that point the picture is gone rather than stuttering and those two see it.
