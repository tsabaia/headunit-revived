/**
 * What the microphone session actually put on the wire.
 *
 * The capture side already says whether the hardware heard anything
 * ([com.andrerinas.openheadunit.decoder.audio.MicRecorder] logs a peak and a byte count). Nothing said
 * whether those bytes then left the head unit, so a reporter log showed `Initializing AudioRecord`
 * and then silence, and a dead input and a dead uplink read identically. This is the missing half:
 * paired with the capture summary it separates "the microphone is routed nowhere" from "we heard it
 * and never sent it".
 *
 * Reported per microphone session rather than per rolling window, because a session is a few
 * seconds and a fixed window would straddle several or none.
 *
 * **Diagnostic only** - nothing reads the report. Pure and clock-free: the caller passes the time,
 * so a measured session replays in a unit test.
