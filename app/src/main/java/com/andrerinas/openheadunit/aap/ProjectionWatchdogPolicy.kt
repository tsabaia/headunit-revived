 * that has stopped is always worth a recovery request and only sometimes worth an overlay.
 *
 * Extracted because the previous inline check cost the watchdog its life on the first tick of
 * every session: it accepted only [CommManager.ConnectionState.HandshakeComplete], but that state
 * is a brief window before video starts - the steady state for the whole drive is
 * [CommManager.ConnectionState.TransportStarted] - and the runnable returned without re-posting
 * itself. Everything hanging off it (the reconnecting overlay, display-stall recovery, the
 * renderer-confirm offer) was unreachable in a normal session, so a video stream that died
 * mid-session stayed black with nothing ever asking for it back.
