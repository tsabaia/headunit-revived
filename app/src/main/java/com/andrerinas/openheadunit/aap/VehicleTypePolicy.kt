/**
 * What kind of vehicle this head unit says it is, in Android Auto's own numbering.
 *
 * The user picks this, but the microphone setting overrides it. A motorcycle is the only claim that
 * makes the phone record with its own microphone instead of asking for ours. It also matters for
 * connecting at all: the phone ships two car services, and the newer one aborts setup when a head
 * unit announces no microphone under any other type. Nothing tells us which one is running, so the
 * claim goes out either way.
 *
 * Pure: no Android, no logging.
